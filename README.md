# GuessingGame-C++

The program will pick a random number from 0 to 99 and you will be guessing this number by providing your guess through stdin.
Depending on which number you have guessed there are 3 outcomes:
• You have guessed the number. Then the program has to tell you that you have won
• Your number is larger than the target one. The program should tell you that its number is
smaller
• Your number is smaller than the target one. The program should tell you that its number is
larger.
The game goes on until you have guessed the number.
